I chose PubMed as my digital library
Link = https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
-HTML was definitely used with this website because I can see it in the top righ corner. CSS was also definitely used and Javascript was likely used even though I can't find much evidence of it
-There were too many github repositories that matched pubmed so I was not sure which one to use
-I couldn't tell how many people built this website but I would assume it is many because of how large the site is
