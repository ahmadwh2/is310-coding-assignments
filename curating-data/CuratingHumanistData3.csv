        Subject: Diagrams 2021: 2nd Call for Graduate Symposium

Dear all

The Diagrams 2021 conference hosts a free graduate symposium. Deadlines
for submission is June 21, so there’s still time!
Please find more information in the call for papers attached below or on
the conference webpage
www.diagrams-conference.org/2021
- and do pass on the information if you know students or recent
graduates for whom it may be relevant.

I hope to see you at the conference!

Best,
Mikkel Willum Johansen
Publicity Chair
Diagrams 2021



Call for Graduate Symposium: Diagrams 2021

12th International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams
September 28 – 30, 2021
Virtual Event
www.diagrams-conference.org/2021<http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2021>

 Highlights of Diagrams 2021 

- FREE REGISTRATION
- Graduate Symposium proceedings will be available online
- Inspirational ECR Speaker: Francesco Bellucci, University of Bologna
- Three Conference Tracks: Main, Philosophy, and Psychology and Education
- Conference proceedings published by Springer
- Best Paper and Best Student Paper awards

- Graduate Symposium submission deadline June 21, 2021.
- Conference paper submission dates in April 2021.


Diagrams is the only conference series that provides a united forum for
all areas that are concerned with the study of diagrams and has a
multidisciplinary emphasis.

The goal of the Diagrams 2021 Graduate Symposium is twofold. Firstly,
the Symposium will provide senior graduate students and recent Masters
and Doctoral graduates with the opportunity to present their research.
Established researchers will provide feedback and comments on each of
the presentations. Secondly, the Symposium will provide students with an
opportunity to network with each other as future colleagues.

In previous Diagrams Graduate Symposiums, lively and useful discussions
have enabled students to receive suggestions about their on-going
research and allowed more experienced participants to hear some fresh
ideas and view some of the new trends in the field.

The Graduate Symposium will include an Inspirational Early Career
Researcher Invited Talk 
(http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2021/index.php/keynotes/). 
The invitation to deliver this talk is reserved for an active Diagrams
researcher, within approximately ten years of their PhD, who has
demonstrable potential to be a major leadership force within the
community. The Inspirational ECR talk will be open to the entire
Diagrams delegation.


Submission Requirements

Submissions that focus on any aspect of diagrams research are welcome.
Topics of interest are the same as those given in the calls for papers
for the three conference tracks:
http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2021/index.php/calls/main-track/
http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2021/index.php/calls/philosophy/
http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2021/index.php/calls/psychology-of-diagrams/.

Students who wish to present their work at the symposium must submit a
3-page report describing

– their thesis topic,
– the approach being taken,
– the work that has been completed,
– the expected contributions of the research
– any necessary acknowledgements (for example, supervision team and
source funding).

The student should be the sole author of their submission and the
supervisor names should be included in the acknowledgements section.

The report must be submitted in Springer LNCS format.

Authors of accepted submissions will be expected to be in attendance at
the virtual conference to present their research and respond to
questions presented by delegates. All presenters must accept that it is
not within the power of the organisers to prevent delegates from
recording  talks. However, when registering, delegates will be asked to
confirm that they will not record any part of the conference.
More details can be found at
http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2021/index.php/calls/graduate-symposium/.


Supervisor Support

Students who submit to the graduate symposium must ask their main or
lead supervisor to submit a short supporting statement, by email to
Mohanad Alqadah, msqadah ‘@’ uqu.edu.sa.

The supporting statement should confirm that the supervisor supports the
student’s participation in the symposium and briefly explain why the
student will benefit.

It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that their supervisor
submits the supporting statement.

        From: Ken Friedman <ken.friedman.sheji@icloud.com>
        Subject: Research Writing Workshop 2021

Dear Colleagues,

To prepare for a lecture next week at Tongji University, I have prepared an
update of the Research Writing Workshop slide deck. If you’d like a copy, you
will find it in .pdf format at this URL:

https://www.academia.edu/2953871/Friedman_2021_Research_Writing_Workshop

As with all previous editions, this document is released under the Creative
Commons license. You are free to use it in teaching, to reprint, and circulate
it as you wish.

When I use it as the basis of a seminar, it requires about three hours.
Sometimes, it may require a little more time when students have many questions.
With the new Zoom technology, I can deliver the seminar remote.

For those who want to go deeper, Prof. Helen Sword has one of the world’s best
web sites. Along with a host of free resources and useful information, there is
a members-only web site called WriteSPACE.

https://www.helensword.com

Prof. Sword’s (2012, 2016, 2017) three books are among the best available on
good writing for academic and scholarly purposes. Her web site is quite useful,
and the members-only site provides valuable resources for those who work with
doctoral students. The bookstore also provides valuable suggestions for library
acquisition — and for your own bookshelf.

While Helen Sword’s work is the best, the Research Writing Workshop remains
useful — and it is free.

https://www.academia.edu/2953871/Friedman_2021_Research_Writing_Workshop

A special tip of the hat to Humanist, where I harvested a very good quote from
Robert Amsler.

Yours,

Ken Friedman

       Subject: microelectronics of the chip & innards of the OS

I'm looking for explanatory literature on two closely related subjects:
the microelectronic design of processors and the structure of operating
systems, in both areas written for the technologically undereducated
(like me). For the former, I am looking for design at the level of the decisions
designers make -- but explained in terms scholars in the human sciences
would understand, perhaps with some effort. For the latter, I am especially
interested in implementation of abstraction levels and information
hiding.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Yours,
WM

large collection of online book reviews. The aim of the project is to translate
concepts of literary theory about how literature works into a computational form
suitable for computational analysis of books and book reviews.

The position is for 3 years at Huygens ING (Amsterdam) and is a collaboration
with the Netherlands eScience Center. More details at:

        Subject: Thursday@4:30 PM ET | What (Might Be) in a Corpus?: Pedagogical Approaches to “Literature in the Digital Age” SHASS Digital Teaching and Research Collaborative Sessions

SHASS Digital Teaching and Research Collaborative Sessions
Thursday, May 13, @ 4:30 PM

Attend via Zoom
(https://mit.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIud-ivrjsqGNxaTcFFf65zKicsyDVnMUlm)

Topic for 5/13. What (Might Be) in a Corpus?: Pedagogical Approaches to
“Literature in the Digital Age” (Wyn Kelley and Erica Zimmer)

How might corpus-based strategies help scholars and students probe
interstitial connections among texts? Literary criticism frequently
takes up the question of how one might relate text to source(s). Yet the
complications of such relationships argue the importance of developing
multiple approaches. Working with digital tools like Voyant
(https://voyant-tools.org/) and AntConc
(https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/) can help bridge gaps
between qualitative and quantitative frames of insight, with an eye to
how moving between the two may itself create perspective.Building on
recent work undertaken with students of Wyn Kelley’s “Textual Mischief:
Literature in the Digital Age,” Kelley and DH Lab Research Associate
Erica Zimmer will present informally on work in progress, while
considering how participants might undertake similar, related
experiments in classes of their own.

Dr. Wyn Kelleyhas been a member of theLiterature
(https://lit.mit.edu/)Faculty since 1985 and has taught classes on
literature of the Americas (in São Paulo, Brazil), digital texts,
environmental writing, literature of migration, North American writers,
and literary modes (comedy, melodrama, gothic), Her scholarship focuses
on Herman Melville’s works in transatlantic contexts and on the
intersections of traditional and new media. Currently Associate Director
of the/Melville Electronic Library (MEL)
(https://melville.electroniclibrary.org/)/, an interactive archive of
Melville’s texts, sources, and adaptations, she is also founding member
of theMelville Society Cultural Project
(https://www.melvillesociety.org/melville-society-cultural-project),
which collaborates with the New Bedford Whaling Museum on projects
related to Melville, whaling, and climate change.

Dr. Erica Zimmercame to MIT in 2017; she is a Lecturer in the
Concourse Program and a Research Associate in MIT’s Programs in Digital
Humanities (https://digitalhumanities.mit.edu/). Her research interests
are literary,historical, and editorial, with emphases in poetics,
material culture, and varied forms of adaptation. This summer, she will
serve as pedagogical technical lead for the Melville Society Cultural
Project’s NEH summer institute,//“/Moby-Dickand the World of Whaling in
the Digital Age (https://teachingmelville.org/)/,” and she is delighted
to contribute to several Literature research initiatives, including
“Global Shakespeares: The Merchant Module
(https://lit.mit.edu/portfolio/shakespeare-modules/).” Her current
digital projects invite multiple points of engagement with bookshops
surrounding London’s St. Paul’s Cathedral before the 1666 Great Fire.

We look forward to welcoming you all!

Very best,
DH Lab x Libs Team

        From: Fabio Ciotti <fabio.ciotti@uniroma2.it>
        Subject: EADH 2022 Call for Hosts

EADH 2022 Call for Hosts

The EADH Executive Committee invites proposals for Local Organisers (LO) to
host the 2022 EADH Conference. The EADH Conference is organised each year
that the annual ADHO Digital Humanities conference takes place outside of
Europe, and has the objective to strengthen the scientific, institutional
and cultural relations between the members of the DH
communities in Europe and the Mediterranean area.

EADH is particularly interested in proposals from institutions and regions
that:

• Have recently developed or are developing digital humanities communities
and organizations;
• Have not previously hosted an ADHO or the EADH Digital Humanities
conference.

Please note that the lead applicant must be a direct member of the EADH or
of one of its Associate Organisations (currently AIUCD [Italy], DHD
[Germany], DHN [Nordic Countries], CzADH [Czechia], and DH Russia).
Organisation

EADH Conferences are co-organised by two committees:

The scientific organisation is conducted by a Programme Committee (PC)
between 8 and 14 members and one Chair, appointed by the EADH Executive
Committee. The local organiser may appoint up to two members of the PC. The
PC decides the main theme of the conference, identifies and invites keynote
speakers, produces and issues the Call for Papers, manages the review
process, and decides the academic conference programme.

The logistical organization will be the responsibility of a Local
Organisation Committee, whose members and chair are appointed by the Local
Organisers.

Time Period and Venue

Conference dates are decided by the Local Organiser, in consultation with
EADH Executive committee. It is recommended that the conference takes place
in the autumn of 2022. Other large DH-related conferences in Europe should
be taken into account when fixing the precise dates.

The venue must be an academic or cultural institution in the European and
Mediterranean area in its broadest sense. The hosting institution should be
able to accommodate a minimum of 300 delegates (including plenaries), at
least three parallel sessions, and a communicative poster session. The
Local Organizers must also have the infrastructure and organizational staff
to guarantee online access to delegates and speakers. The availability of
accommodations at accessible prices is an element that will be considered
in the evaluation of the bid.
Bids

Bids should contain a preliminary budget and up to two pages describing the
motivations and logistical opportunities offered by the proposed venue.

Bidders must take into account the EADH diversity and inclusivity statement
and the ADHO code of conduct.

The venue for the 2022 conference will be decided by the EADH Executive
Committee on the basis of:

• Academic and social impact of the conference for the LO;
• Logistical and economical adequacy of the venue (including costs of
accommodations and availability of a childcare program);
• The overall quality of the proposal.

Bids should be submitted to secretary@eadh.org and CC to
fabio.ciotti@uniroma2.it no later than June 30, 2021.
Structure of the Conference
The Conference should be a 2/3-day event, avoiding weekends. Workshops and
training events can precede the official conference days, depending on the
availability of the LO. Presentations will be organized in 90-minute slots.
The conference should have two keynote plenary talks.

Typical presentations are:

• Long papers for theoretical or highly relevant methodological or
technical issues;
• Short papers to present research ideas, approaches and projects;
• Panel or roundtable for one relevant topic discussed under different
perspectives by 5/6 presenters;
• Posters. One session of the conference is reserved for short poster
presentations.

Bidders in coordination with the Programme Committee are encouraged to
propose alternative formats and innovative organization of the conference
in addition to this general framework.
Budget

The conference must be financially self-sustaining or create a small
surplus. Surpluses and deficits for conference finances are distributed at
a ratio to EADH and to the local organizer according to this formula: 60%
ADHO / 40% LOs. In case of loss, EADH backstop funding will not exceed
€5,000. The EADH will also provide bursaries for young scholars. At least
50% of ADHO’s share of surpluses will be earmarked specifically for future
conference travel bursaries and other pro-inclusion actions.

The local organizers are expected to set six levels of registration fees:

• Faculty and staff with a permanent contract, members of the EADH,
associate organizations, and other constituent organizations of ADHO;
• Faculty and staff with a permanent contract, non-members;
• Faculty and staff with a fixed-term contract, members of the EADH,
associate organizations, and other constituent organizations of ADHO;
• Faculty and staff with a fixed-term contract, non-members;
• Students, members of the EADH, associate organizations, and other
constituent organizations of ADHO;
• Students, non-members.

Local Organisers are expected to set member/non-member rates so that the
difference between member/non-member rates are higher than the EADH
membership costs. Registration fees are recommended not to exceed €300 for
the highest level of non-member fees to make the conference more accessible
to the community.
Social Programme

Local Organisers are expected to arrange a diverse social programme,
including a social dinner, that can contribute to the EADH community
building. Usually, this social programme will highlight the local culture
of the conference venue.
Synergies and Possible Sponsorship

Suggested collaborative activities range from hosting of workshops and
tutorials to co-organisation of the conference or financial support.
Private in-kind and financial sponsorship is welcome, provided that any
activity from sponsoring organizations is clearly distinct from, and does
not influence, the academic program.

        From: Willard McCarty <willard.mccarty@mccarty.org.uk>
        Subject: the 35th year began

Two explanations for my failure to notice and then immediately to 
celebrate the start of Humanist's 35th year occur to me: lapse of 
memory, which at my age would be no surprise, and the felix culpa 
of our time that precipitated Humanist's move to its new 
accommodations. When the old list of members' addresses was used 
to reinvite everyone, it turned out that a large number of them were 
defunct, so the decline in the official number to its present reckoning 
came as no surprise. But that number is slowly increasing, which may 
not be much of a surprise but is certainly welcome.

More is better in this case because of the increase in diversity of
perspectives, interests and research problems. The majority of messages
has likely always been announcements of various kinds -- events,
publications and calls for them. These are, of course, important, as
they carry (portant!) research questions with them, and those sorts of
questions and the conversations that go with them are Humanist's reason
for being as it has developed from its initial, political purpose.

I suspect that one cause of the paucity of explicit questions is a
prevailing reluctance to exhibit one's ignorance, as if we were all
about answers. That may do for fields of activity in which answers
prevail, but this is surely not true of ours. I recall many years ago a
fellow doctoral student said to me that he needed to keep his topic
secret because if others in his field found out what he was doing they
might 'scoop' him. That remark struck me with such force that I can even
remember where I was standing at the time. How odd it seemed to a 
person working on the biblical and classical roots of Milton's 
Paradise Lost :-) ! I fervently hope that fear of being scooped isn't true 
of anyone here present.

All this is by way of encouragement to use Humanist as an instrument of
research and thereby to help celebrate the remarkable privilege of being
able to wonder about difficult things and of having the time to write about it.

Happy 34th birthday when already into the 35th year!

Yours,
WM

first-hand accounts on pioneering efforts to transform computers into
visual and creative media.

Below is an abridged version of the symposium program, which you can
view in full onlattice.space (https://www.lattice.space/), a new
platform for critical and creative research at the nexus of design and
computation. On the website you will also find details about
registration and live-streaming of the event.

The Digital.Visual.Material symposium is linked with the forthcoming
exhibition /Vers un imaginaire numérique
(https://www.lattice.space/topics/vers-un-imaginaire-numerique)/that
will take place September 15-November 7, 2021 at the Centre de Design de
l’UQAM in Montreal. The symposium is supported by the Peter Guo-hua Fu
School of Architecture, McGill University and the Social Sciences and
Humanities Research Council of Canada.

Looking forward to seeing you later in May!

        From: maurizio lana <maurizio.lana@uniupo.it>
        Subject: Re: [Humanist] 35.13: tardy birthday greetings

hi Willard
thank you for the remarks

The majority of messages has likely always been announcements of various kinds
...
I suspect that one cause of the paucity of explicit questions is a
prevailing reluctance to exhibit one's ignorance, as if we were all
about answers

In fact, where Humanist shines is in the short and dense threads
arising from a question.
Usually yours. More often than not, a question that you ...throw in
the middle.

I agree that probably this is because we focus to answers and
questions are felt just as unavoidable steps to get to the answers.
But on answers we are alone, while around questions we gather.
As people who in the night gather around the light of a campfire.
In my experience in no other mailing list do these campfires light
up.

Chrònia pollà!

Two explanations for my failure to notice and then immediately to
celebrate the start of Humanist's 35th year occur to me: lapse of
memory, which at my age would be no surprise, and the felix culpa
of our time that precipitated Humanist's move to its new
accommodations. When the old list of members' addresses was used
to reinvite everyone, it turned out that a large number of them were
defunct, so the decline in the official number to its present reckoning
came as no surprise. But that number is slowly increasing, which may
not be much of a surprise but is certainly welcome.

More is better in this case because of the increase in diversity of
perspectives, interests and research problems. The majority of messages
has likely always been announcements of various kinds -- events,
publications and calls for them. These are, of course, important, as
they carry (portant!) research questions with them, and those sorts of
questions and the conversations that go with them are Humanist's reason
for being as it has developed from its initial, political purpose.

I suspect that one cause of the paucity of explicit questions is a
prevailing reluctance to exhibit one's ignorance, as if we were all
about answers. That may do for fields of activity in which answers
prevail, but this is surely not true of ours. I recall many years ago a
fellow doctoral student said to me that he needed to keep his topic
secret because if others in his field found out what he was doing they
might 'scoop' him. That remark struck me with such force that I can even
remember where I was standing at the time. How odd it seemed to a
person working on the biblical and classical roots of Milton's
Paradise Lost :-) ! I fervently hope that fear of being scooped isn't true
of anyone here present.

All this is by way of encouragement to use Humanist as an instrument of
research and thereby to help celebrate the remarkable privilege of being
able to wonder about difficult things and of having the time to write about it.

Happy 34th birthday when already into the 35th year!

Yours,
WM

Data is everywhere. While ‘big’ data may have once seemed limited to
business or high tech, ethnographers are now finding data – and its
attendant values and practices – in their field sites around the world.
Data has motivated a sweep of dystopian visions, signalling the invasion
of privacy, political manipulation, or shadowy data doubles. Yet
anthropologists have been cautious in taking data itself as an object of
theoretical interest, even as the effects of data become manifest in our
ethnographies.

This volume presents a set of theoretically inventive pieces that engage
with data across its many locations, from government databases to
ecological field stations, from kitchen tables to concrete bunkers. The
contributors demonstrate how thinking with data can be conceptually
generative for anthropology, prompting us to reconsider our
understanding of topics including bodies, persons, and the social
itself. ‘Data’ is a notoriously slippery concept, often supporting
claims to remote objectivity and universality; by putting data in its
place, the pieces collected here develop conceptual tools that will
prove useful for anthropologists who find ‘data’ in their data.

This collection of essays explores digital art in Ireland. Comprising
contributions from scholars and practitioners, it examines how new media
technologies are shaping the island’s contemporary artistic practices.
As one of the first dedicated treatments of Irish digital art, it fills
a major gap in the national media archaeology of Ireland.

ways of seeing, knowing, articulating, and transforming arguments into
dialogue in order to foster and to intensify collaborations between
humanities and visualization researchers. We are particularly interested
in papers and provocations that bring different disciplines together.

# CfP - Paper Track

This year, VIS4DH will revolve around the topic of “scale”.
Visualization is often celebrated as a method to facilitate the
exploration and interpretation of “big data”. But is scale a relevant
yardstick to measure and characterize the challenges connected to
humanities research questions? Scholars have warned about the
development and focus on large-scale digital infrastructures within the
humanities, suggesting that smaller datasets and lighter infrastructures
could better support the needs of humanist researchers. Additionally,
critical voices have pointed out the risk of reproducing assumptions
about dominant cultures and groups while further marginalizing those who
are less likely to be remembered. ‘Data humanism’ has been proposed to
highlight the creative potential of “small data” in terms of personal
impact. Choices of scale—in terms of data, tools, or teams—influence not
only project outcomes but also research methods and processes.

This year, we invite work around (but not limited to) the following
questions:

- Large scale approaches have been said to easily ignore context, to
fetishize size and inflate their technical and scientific capabilities,
which they rarely deliver. How can we mitigate these issues and effects
of scale for existing large scale data infrastructures?
- What other motivating factors should be taken into account regardless
of scale? Are “volume, velocity and variety” our defining challenges, or
should we deliberately shift the problem characterization in humanities
projects towards data scarcity, sparsity, polysemy, uncertainty,
historicity, quality, and contextuality?
- What goes unseen when we look at massive datasets and large trends?
How can information visualization techniques assist in bridging small
and large scale findings?
- How can we envision small data, small processes, small impact for
visualization in the humanities?
- What trade-offs in visibility (and in-visibility) are made when we
consider different scales in projects at the intersection of
visualization and the humanities research?
- How can research at the intersection of visualization and the
humanities counteract the dangers of data colonialism and of excluding
marginalized positions?

We invite papers at the intersection of visualization and (digital)
humanities that provide both theoretical and applied perspectives around
these and other questions.

For our paper track we are seeking works from scholars in visualization,
the humanities, social science, and the arts who use visualization as
part of the process of analyzing and interrogating human culture.

Submissions will present original research ideas or results as they
relate to visualization for the digital humanities. Each submission
should clearly state its specific contribution to this growing field of
research.

# Submission format

Submissions will take the form of short (4-6 page - excluding
references) papers. Submissions are meant to describe and critically
discuss works at the intersection of visualization and humanities
research, including applied case studies and empirical results and/or
theoretical perspectives. We welcome works that highlight the
difficulties (and proposed solutions) of designing visualizations in the
context of humanities research and/or applying concepts from humanities
research to foster visualization research and design.

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their paper at the
workshop as a pre-recorded video plus online discussion. All
presentations will be followed by a lively discussion with workshop
participants. The archiving and publication options for VIS4DH 2021 are
still under development and will be detailed soon.

# Submitting a paper

Paper submissions should be in PDF format following the two-column IEEE
TVCG Conference Style Template
(http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html).

Diagrammatic forms of visualization are ubiquitous in scientific
publications, as well as in popular mediations of scientific contents.
Every computer interface relies on diagrammatic forms, combining textual
and graphical elements. Diagrams abstract and encode information. They
are indispensable in many scientific contexts, and, together with charts
and graphs, also in the daily media, reaching a wide audience of experts
and non-experts.

As natural and familiar as these abstract forms of representing
information are to us, they are products of many historical
developments. Their historical roots may go back to prehistoric epochs.
However, the historical integration of diagrams in scientific contexts
is relatively recent. Even if these developments with regard to Western
cultures have their origin in antiquity and were significantly developed
further in the sciences of the Middle Ages, the early modern period can
be considered the first flourishing phase of the diagram in practically
all areas of the sciences of that time.

This event proposes to trace this historical development in the early
modern period. It takes a truly interdisciplinary approach when talking
about a timespan of roughly 500 years (1300-1800) across all early
modern sciences, from Architecture to Zodiac men in medicine. The talks
bring together research on the culture of the diagram in various
sciences of the epoch to form a large overall picture.

This event aims at tracing the emergences and the disruptions of
traditions of diagrams in all fields of scientific theory and practice,
e.g. (but not restricted to) geometry, astronomy, medicine, philosophy,
alchemy, law, theology, and music.

It will address, among others, questions such as the following:

1. Do the diagrams under investigation come from a precise tradition or
do they form the foundation of such a tradition?

2. What is the scientific/disciplinary context of the diagrams under
investigation and how do they relate to it?

3. What is the aim of the diagra"

        Subject: Recruiting collaborators for Humanities for Change Messaggio di posta da Bembus Project: Recruiting collaborators for Humanities for Change

Dear all,


the international non-profit network Humanities for Change is planning to
restart its activities after some months of break and, for this reason, is
looking for new collaborators willing to take part in the project.

We are looking for talented and ambitious young scholars who want to stick their
necks out and take on new challenges, especially in the area of didactic
innovations and new job opportunities for humanists (e.g. HR, digital
marketing...). We intend to forge relationships with private companies and
educational institutions and develop projects with them aimed at job
placement. If you are interested, if you have any ideas or want to seize the
challenge, please email info@bembus.org.

Humanities for Change (provisional website: https://humanitiesforchange.org) is
an international network of students and young scholars who are committed to
establishing a different role for the humanistic disciplines in the present
time. Its activity of divulgation is concentrated on certain fundamental themes,
such as: the digital and public humanities, innovative professional
opportunities for graduates of this field, the reflection on innovations in the
didactic environment and the potential derived from the collaboration with hard
sciences. More information about Humanities for Change can be found in this
presentation: https://handbook.pubpub.org/pub/case-
humanitiesforchange/release/1.
